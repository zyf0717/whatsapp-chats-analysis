16/08/2023, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: I think it's due to the hedging gains that's why profit margin is much higher than ebitda margin, so I had to ask our FR guy to breakdown the net income. then have to go tell him how to focus, don't spend ur time breaking down all the small amounts
16/08/2023, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: when I stood up, mini boss was like u have a qn for me?
16/08/2023, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: whut, why would I need to stand up to ask the person next to me a qn

16/08/2023, 7:01 pm - Yvette Chen: then the brazil ceo for some reason is coming for 1.5 weeks end of the month. intersects with election day so there's technically only 6 working days
16/08/2023, 7:02 pm - Yvette Chen: I sincerely hope he doesn't extend his trip to attend phase 1 now that it's earlier. it just means more ppl taking up ur time instead of effectively working

06/12/2023, 9:21 am - Yvette Chen: and the Brazil tissue team refused to provide a flash PowerPoint report for 2 months, then this month we need to reuse some budget slides for Chairman meeting. told them to update the budget slides with Nov numbers and they insisted on sending flash PowerPoint to us 2 days in a row

06/12/2023, 11:02 pm - Yvette Chen: also I'm sick of these arrogant folks. when the coo questioned the technical team why they hadn't replied controllers' request for info for 2 months, they just said our requests weren't specific enough. uhh how to specify when we're not engineers? might as well tell us to never request things from them :)
06/12/2023, 11:03 pm - Yvette Chen: the coo is their boss, he was also speechless. since he got scolded by ceo when controllers presented a million blanks in the slides
06/12/2023, 11:03 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
06/12/2023, 11:03 pm - Zheng Yifei: ignore request instead of clarifying = low IQ
06/12/2023, 11:06 pm - Yvette Chen: then just now the 7pm meeting, the brazil tissue head sent a lady to sub him just because she can speak english but she has zero knowledge on the topic <This message was edited>
06/12/2023, 11:07 pm - Yvette Chen: the questions were listed in the agenda since last week. I in fact had to tell her to go grab the two brazilian ladies who do the work and just act as a translator <This message was edited>
06/12/2023, 11:09 pm - Yvette Chen: the disrespect for your time is just meh. the hk lady wanted to faint alr and her staff (our welfare auntie in SG) is like oh my you two are handing over this problematic group to me in future?
06/12/2023, 11:10 pm - Yvette Chen: too bad for her oops
06/12/2023, 11:16 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
06/12/2023, 11:20 pm - Yvette Chen: dodo is like extremely cautious. it's quite funny so I still haven't clarified
06/12/2023, 11:20 pm - Zheng Yifei: Heh?

06/12/2023, 11:22 pm - Yvette Chen: delete message
06/12/2023, 11:22 pm - Yvette Chen: ok how does 1.30 sound
06/12/2023, 11:23 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway I'm meeting zhuwei for dinner outside cos she's way more reliable on timing
06/12/2023, 11:25 pm - Yvette Chen: at the same time I'm wondering whether bringing my mum for an 8 course vegetarian meal is wise (she wants an early bday celebration since we won't be in the country on her bday)
06/12/2023, 11:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: Ic

07/12/2023, 7:57 pm - Yvette Chen: like everything that can go wrong just went wrong
07/12/2023, 7:58 pm - Yvette Chen: my boss try to play nice with indonesia hr by saying jokingly saying no one at hq will cook the numbers lah. but the hr just blatantly refuse to cooperate
07/12/2023, 8:00 pm - Yvette Chen: then brazil cfo confirmed we need to change budget 2024 so I have to do a detailed comparison project by project just to show that we didn't anyhow increase the total capex requirements for 2023+2024
07/12/2023, 8:00 pm - Yvette Chen: they did slyly increase by $6m so boss told me to report it
07/12/2023, 8:02 pm - Yvette Chen: then Indonesia hq rush us to provide data for benchmarking. turned out they seriously just do one slide and sent to the prince
07/12/2023, 8:03 pm - Yvette Chen: the prince cannot believe it so he ask us for our detailed benchmarking which was still dated last month
07/12/2023, 8:04 pm - Yvette Chen: then brazil ceo was like eh why you guys haven't done the detailed fixed cost benchmarking yet, so I chase Indonesia finance (request sent 2 weeks ago)
07/12/2023, 8:04 pm - Yvette Chen: they complain to Indonesia hq, so Celine came over to my desk
07/12/2023, 8:06 pm - Yvette Chen: her style is to be super loud and that's embarrassing in an open concept office, so I was a little stern like why china team can do it leh, what exactly does Indonesia team not understand
07/12/2023, 8:08 pm - Yvette Chen: then she tried to say oh you know you can find the data here and just apply a percentage to do an estimate by yourself, I just said yes but it has to come from Indonesia team because we don't want another instance of "I don't recognise the number, I'm not liable to explain". Basically using Indonesia HR's dumb attitude to my advantage now
07/12/2023, 8:09 pm - Yvette Chen: actually more like I just don't care how it affects celine since she's leaving alr
07/12/2023, 8:09 pm - Yvette Chen: ok end of rant for the day

02/01/2024, 5:52 pm - Yvette Chen: Btw neat trick if you’re booking hotels, pick your desired hotel then find an available rate on an OTA platform (booking.com etc) that’s lower than the hotel’s own website. 

Ask the hotel not only to match but to give you a 20% discount vs the OTA rate. We’ve tried a couple of times with a few hotels and it’s worked for a good ~70% of them.
02/01/2024, 5:52 pm - Yvette Chen: It works because hotels pay OTAs up to 30/40% of their list price as fees.
02/01/2024, 5:52 pm - Yvette Chen: from deb hahaha

11/01/2024, 6:50 pm - Zheng Yifei: You be buying the food from boleh boleh?
11/01/2024, 6:50 pm - Yvette Chen: then we went to get coffee. ran into mei ling + kong chyi. I made it a point to go up to them and say hi mei ling and kong chyi, just to prove I rmb his name now. and he was like you should come later then I let you cut queue
11/01/2024, 6:50 pm - Yvette Chen: yes, on the train now :)
11/01/2024, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: then I realised wei xian and linda disappeared so I went to ask them whether they're buying on the app. so I followed suit, since the physical queue is insanely long
11/01/2024, 6:52 pm - Yvette Chen: then it's like the next number. lol
11/01/2024, 6:53 pm - Yvette Chen: so before I left, I went to tell the mei ling and kong chyi btw can order on the app... just in case they wonder why I just happily get the drink first and go off on my own
11/01/2024, 6:55 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
11/01/2024, 6:55 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway my drink overflowed again today. linda almost got scalded cos she said v loudly I help you take and didn't wait for my reply
11/01/2024, 6:55 pm - Zheng Yifei: seems like lunch and coffee be a source of entertainment
11/01/2024, 6:56 pm - Yvette Chen: yea then I'm wearing casual today cos I'm sick of office wear even though we have a dress code. meh

11/01/2024, 6:58 pm - Yvette Chen: there was some argument between her and wei liang that she doesn't want to do weekly
11/01/2024, 6:59 pm - Yvette Chen: the hk cash lead has to step in and say you two can take this offline with josh later

12/01/2024, 6:48 pm - Yvette Chen: okie
12/01/2024, 6:48 pm - Yvette Chen: I arrived after 9.30 cos I know there's a weekly sales meeting and that means mini boss and xinyi won't know what time I came in
12/01/2024, 6:50 pm - Yvette Chen: then the office admin brought wei liang and me snacks from japan. which is damn weird cos she always smiles at me too friendly. it's like I know you paiseh to only give him and not give me. no need to extend the moment and make it weird :)
12/01/2024, 6:50 pm - Yvette Chen: I basically didn't do much today cos the brazilians only submitted drafts so I didn't want to chiong and then have to change all the slides next week
12/01/2024, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: then I smelt myself cos somehow I keep smelling salted fish and wondered if it came from my jacket
12/01/2024, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: It didn't
12/01/2024, 6:51 pm - Zheng Yifei: Whut
12/01/2024, 6:51 pm - Yvette Chen: dunno who brought salted fish
12/01/2024, 6:52 pm - Yvette Chen: also I'm wearing the jacket that was on the bed so I was thinking was there blood stain that I wasn't aware of. cos that'll give off that iron smell
12/01/2024, 6:53 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway I went to have thai food with ian and linda today. she's always so happy that I'm joining
12/01/2024, 6:53 pm - Yvette Chen: the waiting time was super long
12/01/2024, 6:54 pm - Yvette Chen: so we ended up chatting for very long. and linda had to leave at 5pm to go to her bf's house in msia for the weekend lol
12/01/2024, 6:55 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway by the time we got to the coffee store they were cleaning up alr. In fact the bakery beside it was closed liao at 2.45pm
12/01/2024, 6:56 pm - Yvette Chen: then for some reason linda was asking whether it's ok to eat two eggs per day cos she noticed xinyi doing that. I'm like seems very high cholesterol but xinyi doesn't eat lunch, so maybe that offsets
12/01/2024, 6:57 pm - Yvette Chen: then ian was like it depends on your family history and that his has a lot, and then looks at me
12/01/2024, 6:57 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm like oh my family has a lot..... well, a lot
12/01/2024, 6:58 pm - Yvette Chen: lol then he went to order from the auntie
12/01/2024, 6:59 pm - Yvette Chen: after he ordered, the auntie just exited to clean the front of the counter. I dunno whether it's cos she wants me to order from her daughter or what
12/01/2024, 7:00 pm - Zheng Yifei: Whut
12/01/2024, 7:01 pm - Yvette Chen: then got two foreigners asking me for directions (daily stranger interaction seriously...)
12/01/2024, 7:01 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway before we got to the store, linda alr told me she's buying a drink today so I thought she would go order hers while this was happening
12/01/2024, 7:03 pm - Yvette Chen: after this, I realised she didnt. So I'm like would you like to order first. but the auntie just called me "meimei what drink you want"
12/01/2024, 7:04 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
12/01/2024, 7:04 pm - Yvette Chen: I was like ok hot yuan yang. they totally deviate from sop right... the auntie continue to clean the counter and the daughter just start making the drink
12/01/2024, 7:05 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm like ok opens paylah since it doesn't seem like paywave is an option today
12/01/2024, 7:07 pm - Yvette Chen: halfway through making the drink, the daughter comes over to press on the counter and opens the membership thingy for me to enter my number, instead of opening the paywave thing. which rly isn't required
12/01/2024, 7:07 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
12/01/2024, 7:07 pm - Zheng Yifei: Must be on purpose
12/01/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: so then I finished paying without saying a word and took the drink. then they went back to sop for linda
12/01/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: the counter isn't even clean yet
12/01/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: walao these two
12/01/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: actually just the auntie
12/01/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: hahaha
12/01/2024, 7:09 pm - Yvette Chen: ok going over to eat
12/01/2024, 7:09 pm - Zheng Yifei: I’m on the bus
12/01/2024, 7:09 pm - Zheng Yifei: For some reason no bus until now
12/01/2024, 7:11 pm - Yvette Chen: orh :)
12/01/2024, 7:13 pm - Yvette Chen: I've reached. sit down and wait for you first

22/01/2024, 7:32 pm - Yvette Chen: she basically told me that her daughter got dumped by a guy cos she didn't wanna put out
22/01/2024, 7:33 pm - Yvette Chen: I was like umm woah auntie you are very close to your daughter, btw how do I redeem a drink

22/01/2024, 8:11 pm - Yvette Chen: though I'm thinking part of the reason she's so fast at producing our drinks is to reduce the amt of time her mum can say embarrassing things

25/01/2024, 9:55 am - Zheng Yifei: hehehe

25/01/2024, 9:56 am - Zheng Yifei: its worse
25/01/2024, 9:56 am - Yvette Chen: actually the arcade foodstores are like that too, so maybe it's considered old school

25/01/2024, 9:58 am - Zheng Yifei: my camera bag barely has space on the floor
25/01/2024, 9:58 am - Zheng Yifei: i bet covid ripped this place apart
25/01/2024, 9:58 am - Yvette Chen: maybe that's why they were confused by why there's a stampede in korea
25/01/2024, 9:58 am - Zheng Yifei: they are like aint that normal

25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Yvette Chen: cannot double click
25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Zheng Yifei: Enter
25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Yvette Chen: can't 🤔
25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Zheng Yifei: Heh?
25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Zheng Yifei: Why does this kind of random happen when I’m not home 🤔
25/01/2024, 9:08 pm - Yvette Chen: keyboard not connected 😅
25/01/2024, 9:09 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hold the power button to force reboot I guess
25/01/2024, 9:09 pm - Zheng Yifei: Or you can connect the keyboard on the floor to try to enter

25/01/2024, 9:10 pm - Yvette Chen: I literally need to climb into the side of the table
25/01/2024, 9:10 pm - Zheng Yifei: The method to not get it stuck is slowly press down until you hear the booting start then release the button

26/01/2024, 8:53 am - Zheng Yifei: It’s a bus that leaves every 30min so schedule is important

26/01/2024, 5:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: They sometimes do and sometimes don’t follow a schedule
26/01/2024, 5:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: Which is a problem when some buses only come once per hour or half hour
26/01/2024, 5:28 pm - Zheng Yifei: Then their bus API not updated, so google maps show things that are not correct
26/01/2024, 5:28 pm - Zheng Yifei: How do the locals live with this shit
26/01/2024, 5:28 pm - Yvette Chen: hahaha hk ppl just diy everything 🫢 it's the opposite of jap culture
26/01/2024, 5:29 pm - Yvette Chen: that's why they're always cursing in cantonese

27/01/2024, 7:00 pm - Zheng Yifei: Things like taste
27/01/2024, 7:00 pm - Zheng Yifei: A lot of emphasis on just marginal quality
27/01/2024, 7:01 pm - Yvette Chen: My response was actually why don't you ask your staff to stay back and try. then she says umm I need to pay them to wait for her to do up the recipes

28/01/2024, 1:09 pm - Yvette Chen: why I didn't ask? cos it seemed rude to comment
28/01/2024, 1:10 pm - Yvette Chen: should I have asked 🤔
28/01/2024, 1:10 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm watching this show called death and other deaths

28/01/2024, 1:11 pm - Zheng Yifei: My stomach feels weird
28/01/2024, 1:11 pm - Zheng Yifei: I’m sitting on a toilet hehe
28/01/2024, 1:11 pm - Yvette Chen: I thought it's very gory or sth due to the title and it's r21
28/01/2024, 1:13 pm - Yvette Chen: after half an episode, I'm starting to think it's cos of lesbian sex
28/01/2024, 1:13 pm - Yvette Chen: cos they seem to skip all the violence enacted by the serial murderer 🤔
28/01/2024, 1:14 pm - Yvette Chen: oh noes
28/01/2024, 1:14 pm - Yvette Chen: oh ya I did have diarrhea last night, 3 times

28/01/2024, 1:18 pm - Yvette Chen: I ate the leftovers from last night. microwave :)
28/01/2024, 1:18 pm - Zheng Yifei: Ic
28/01/2024, 1:18 pm - Yvette Chen: she ate so little, no wonder she thought 3 mini bowls is enough for 2 ppl
28/01/2024, 1:20 pm - Yvette Chen: also the conversation got v heavy after that
28/01/2024, 1:20 pm - Zheng Yifei: Whut
28/01/2024, 1:21 pm - Yvette Chen: I asked her whether she cooks her own meals (cos the food was confusingly bad)
28/01/2024, 1:22 pm - Yvette Chen: she said no, so I'm like maybe start there and it's also possible to make your family your guinea pigs. they'd have a strong incentive to help you (I mean once you start affecting both their daily meals and the fam biz right)
28/01/2024, 1:26 pm - Yvette Chen: then it was silence. Basically I didn't intend to spend the evening with anyone. so I'm like maybe proceed with what I wanted to do tonight anyway - play the 三国 game, so I just cast on the TV from my phone
28/01/2024, 1:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: What’s that
28/01/2024, 1:28 pm - Yvette Chen: it's a v dumb game, I just wanted to try. basically you interact with characters and make choices to keep your stats in equilibrium. the end goal is to conquer 13 states
28/01/2024, 1:29 pm - Yvette Chen: just when I was getting bored, she asked whether i always play thinking games <This message was edited>
28/01/2024, 1:30 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
28/01/2024, 1:31 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm like yea pretty much but for dramas, I do a wider range. so she looked at me, it's like asking like what
28/01/2024, 1:33 pm - Yvette Chen: so I switched to disney+ since flex x cop episode 2 was out by then. and said so like detective or superhero shows, or romcoms like this
28/01/2024, 1:35 pm - Yvette Chen: and I started watching while giving her a rundown of what episode 1 was abt
28/01/2024, 1:37 pm - Yvette Chen: at this point I felt it's pretty weird cos I'm just doing whatever I want? then I asked her whether she needs to work tmr (cos it's alr 11 and maybe it's a cue that she should go home)
28/01/2024, 1:40 pm - Yvette Chen: then she said she does, but she feels she's been working too much. I'm like yea you just opened a few new stores. maybe it's more prudent to rest after running around all day than to overstretch urself with r&d
28/01/2024, 1:43 pm - Yvette Chen: then she said she's working so she can stop fixating on one thing. she thinks she's falling in love with me. lol
28/01/2024, 1:44 pm - Yvette Chen: I almost sighed but I caught myself. l asked why would she think so, we barely know each other
28/01/2024, 1:45 pm - Yvette Chen: then she say I'm kind, friendly and smart, and... I'm not obsessed abt sex like other ppl <This message was edited>
28/01/2024, 1:47 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm like ok you're probably not in love with me, you're looking for a partner who doesn't want to have sex
28/01/2024, 1:50 pm - Yvette Chen: so we just ended up talking abt this for a bit (even though I know next to nothing abt the ace community other than todd from the bojack horseman cartoon)
28/01/2024, 1:51 pm - Yvette Chen: then we finished watching the episode and she's like should I go? I'm like yea...
28/01/2024, 1:51 pm - Yvette Chen: lol
28/01/2024, 1:53 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol

28/01/2024, 1:54 pm - Zheng Yifei: Chick magnet
28/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Yvette Chen: yea then I switched off everything and tried to shuishui but ended up with diarrhea, then I could shuishui
28/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Yvette Chen: 😂
28/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Zheng Yifei: Whut
28/01/2024, 1:58 pm - Zheng Yifei: Ic
28/01/2024, 2:01 pm - Yvette Chen: she's too innocent, like why would anyone mention sex to an acquaintance. I contemplated saying that's not true but decided not to
28/01/2024, 2:02 pm - Yvette Chen: fact is, I also hardly talk abt it with my friends 🤔
28/01/2024, 2:02 pm - Yvette Chen: hehe what's for lunch for hubby :)

28/01/2024, 2:07 pm - Zheng Yifei: It’s like KFC
28/01/2024, 2:08 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm like maybe jollibean and he's like I don't like soy bean
28/01/2024, 2:08 pm - Yvette Chen: why? cos we always drink that in ns for breakfast
28/01/2024, 2:09 pm - Yvette Chen: then on friday the tax director wanted pineapple tarts for gifting. I'm like maybe sunnyhills? I saw a booth at the mrt exchange, it has individual packs so should be easy to give out
28/01/2024, 2:09 pm - Yvette Chen: then he was like oh no I don't like sunnyhills
28/01/2024, 2:09 pm - Yvette Chen: why? cos we used to have that for supper in ns

28/01/2024, 11:29 pm - Yvette Chen: the only reason I haven't gone is cos they also sell bread (their tuna is v popular) so it's a little bit of chaos at the cashier

22/02/2024, 7:04 pm - Yvette Chen: like they keep setting the jul to dec forecast incorrectly cos they keep trying to get the data from the weekly sales meeting files
22/02/2024, 7:05 pm - Yvette Chen: the weekly sales meeting is for immediate shipments, so as most accurate for next 3 months' billing. no one cares if xinyi updates the remaining months

22/02/2024, 7:06 pm - Yvette Chen: so basically they redid the file 3 times cos of this one dumb error

22/02/2024, 7:07 pm - Yvette Chen: then they ask me why they can't just put all the sales volume in dec. siao bo, then year end receivables so high. fulll year working capital suddenly miss target by $100m
22/02/2024, 7:08 pm - Yvette Chen: plus we don't even do fifo so dec has the lowest cost per ton due to prepayments in the year, suddenly ebitda also overstated by $20m
22/02/2024, 7:09 pm - Yvette Chen: it's only january results for god's sake. I don't get why they're doing this <This message was edited>

28/02/2024, 6:20 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
28/02/2024, 6:20 pm - Yvette Chen: I think she found linda's comment funny, but as hr you either step in to say this is inappropriate or you shut up

28/02/2024, 6:23 pm - Zheng Yifei: Also why are there so many lesbians
28/02/2024, 6:23 pm - Yvette Chen: so I suspect the hugging incident was simply she overheard what yuki was saying hahaha <This message was edited>
28/02/2024, 6:24 pm - Yvette Chen: she's super career minded
28/02/2024, 6:24 pm - Yvette Chen: apparently she took a bigger portfolio after celine left cos she wants to rise

28/02/2024, 6:27 pm - Yvette Chen: yuki is still a confused kid
28/02/2024, 6:28 pm - Yvette Chen: mei ling is ? maybe she's just hoping to have one friend in the company, that's not one of the flies who keep surrounding her out of lust

01/03/2024, 1:02 pm - Yvette Chen: I assumed he used to live on another planet? 🤔
01/03/2024, 1:03 pm - Yvette Chen: maybe you're right

04/03/2024, 6:22 pm - Zheng Yifei: This message was deleted
04/03/2024, 6:22 pm - Zheng Yifei: I should ask her why she no need work lol
04/03/2024, 6:34 pm - Yvette Chen: do you wanna go any of those?
04/03/2024, 6:34 pm - Yvette Chen: going home :)
04/03/2024, 6:46 pm - Yvette Chen: I kinda snapped at ian today but I know he's not the cause of it, just bearing the brunt of it
04/03/2024, 6:53 pm - Yvette Chen: firstly the corporate cash lady yelled at me over the phone for not replying her urgent request to call over the weekend (well because she has a track record of saying it's urgent when it's not)
04/03/2024, 6:55 pm - Zheng Yifei: need to find out what this is hehe
04/03/2024, 6:57 pm - Yvette Chen: this morning she wants to compare feb forecast to dec forecast instead of to jan forecast, which is extremely weird. and only first 6 months zzz, our standard practice is to look 3 months ahead and then just balance out in full year
04/03/2024, 6:58 pm - Yvette Chen: keeps insisting the difference is from this line which I explained it's our balancing number, and that I need to rebalance the numbers if she wants an accurate first 6 months view. <This message was edited>
04/03/2024, 6:59 pm - Yvette Chen: she also highlighted twice my boss usually works weekends. I refrained from saying then why didn't you call him, clearly this wasn't rly urgent <This message was edited>
04/03/2024, 7:03 pm - Yvette Chen: then I had to go on a zoom with internal audit. couldn't pick up her chaser calls, so got more scoldings after that. like my dear I don't have only this one task
04/03/2024, 7:26 pm - Yvette Chen: just reached home
04/03/2024, 7:26 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway lunch time rolls around, and josh & wei liang need to rush back in 1h for a meeting
04/03/2024, 7:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: you be boiling dumplings?
04/03/2024, 7:28 pm - Yvette Chen: after wei liang takes ages to finish his meal as usual, josh tried to suggest we have coffee at capital spring itself. but somehow ian objected so we walked a super long way (it was raining cats and dogs) to get to the usual coffee store
04/03/2024, 7:29 pm - Yvette Chen: josh wanted wei liang to order for two of them online first so they can get the drink and go back asap ie the rest can do whatever they want
04/03/2024, 7:29 pm - Yvette Chen: ian asked us whether we want to order online. I'm like oh send me the link then, and jokingly said I swear I will bookmark it this time
04/03/2024, 7:32 pm - Yvette Chen: the 3 reach and immediately collect. wei xian and lynn were telling me when we're reaching that the link doesn't work (he sent to the ops chat, I'm not in ops but I didn't say anything cos I was wondering whether to roam elsewhere later and let off steam)
04/03/2024, 7:33 pm - Yvette Chen: cues the worst possible reaction he could have chosen
04/03/2024, 7:34 pm - Yvette Chen: there're a million ppl underground since it's pouring outside. he asked me what my order number is v loudly, I'm like I haven't ordered. have you sent the link?
04/03/2024, 7:35 pm - Yvette Chen: then he said, I sent alr! why do you always not receive my messages! is this how you buy time for work? <This message was edited>
04/03/2024, 7:36 pm - Yvette Chen: I dunno what my expression was but it couldn't have been anywhere friendly. I said seriously who did you send it to, and walked away to scan the qr myself <This message was edited>
04/03/2024, 7:43 pm - Yvette Chen: after I finished ordering, he sheepishly said he sent to the wrong group chat
04/03/2024, 7:45 pm - Yvette Chen: seriously I know the ops chat is exclusive for complaints about how the mr team (ie josh, wei liang and myself are not inside) asks a lot of questions and is always rushing them for stuff, hence I never asked to join. but an accusation for your own oversight was infuriating
04/03/2024, 7:45 pm - Yvette Chen: yup :)
04/03/2024, 7:46 pm - Zheng Yifei: Omw home from Little India
04/03/2024, 7:47 pm - Zheng Yifei: wtf
04/03/2024, 7:50 pm - Yvette Chen: orh :)
04/03/2024, 7:52 pm - Yvette Chen: probably meant it as a joke but definitely wrong time wrong place
04/03/2024, 7:52 pm - Zheng Yifei: I think boss cannot make such jokes
04/03/2024, 7:52 pm - Zheng Yifei: 0 EQ
04/03/2024, 7:53 pm - Zheng Yifei: When boss says that its equivalent to an accusation
04/03/2024, 7:53 pm - Yvette Chen: this is ian (he's a tax manager with no staff). is this a highly paid minion or a boss 🤔 <This message was edited>
04/03/2024, 7:56 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol ic
04/03/2024, 7:56 pm - Zheng Yifei: Tax meh

04/03/2024, 8:05 pm - Zheng Yifei: It’s called ninjas
04/03/2024, 8:06 pm - Zheng Yifei: It’s called that because they believe I’m super sneaky and knows everything
04/03/2024, 8:06 pm - Yvette Chen: hehe it's named after you? :)
04/03/2024, 8:11 pm - Zheng Yifei: The group name is 10 ninja emojis

04/03/2024, 8:28 pm - Zheng Yifei: So fast?
04/03/2024, 8:28 pm - Yvette Chen: probably heavy flow that day, I don't actually want to go out but it doesn't seem like we have a choice in dates
04/03/2024, 8:28 pm - Yvette Chen: just go or don't go only :)
04/03/2024, 8:29 pm - Zheng Yifei: Ic
04/03/2024, 8:29 pm - Yvette Chen: in fact I know dodo said she's only rly sure she can make it on fridays but zhuwei's choices trump hers I guess
04/03/2024, 8:31 pm - Yvette Chen: the dynamics is not v healthy 🤔

05/03/2024, 6:45 pm - Yvette Chen: in my head I was like, I don't think the gceo would even approve the gcfo's trip if this is the justification
05/03/2024, 6:45 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
05/03/2024, 6:45 pm - Yvette Chen: why need to bring 3 controllers along?

05/03/2024, 6:46 pm - Yvette Chen: also cos gcfo wants to visit our trading posts in dubai for 1 day but I'm not in charge of sales, so josh feels I can miss that
05/03/2024, 6:47 pm - Yvette Chen: precisely but then corporate also reports to gcfo so it's not a valid excuse
05/03/2024, 6:48 pm - Yvette Chen: anyway after that gceo told gcfo to postpone, it's premature blah blah (aka corporate speak for don't waste money)

10/04/2024, 9:27 am - Yvette Chen: And when I asked you not to because it hurts me, you said she's nice and asked whether I want to meet her. why would that be a reasonable outcome?

10/04/2024, 9:29 am - Zheng Yifei: It’s just to show you she’s a friend, but I guess that doesn’t matter
10/04/2024, 9:29 am - Yvette Chen: when it's obvious I'm sick, you still went out to meet another girl anyway and asked me to go out at a later time for lunch. Well the message couldn't be more clear

12/04/2024, 3:28 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hi Honey,

It has been years since I have last written to you. Even after almost 15 years together I believe I still have trouble articulating in-person – written words are simply more precise, thorough, and refined after all.

Or perhaps I am still just cowardly at expressing my feelings, and it is something for me to reflect and work on.

The theme of the current, albeit short, chapter of my life has been Personal Development, not in a technical competency sense, but in my understanding of Self, my Character, and the direction I wish to head towards. I believe 修身 would be a very apt description.

The very many epiphanies I have had during this period is actually a crystallization and consolidation of intuitive and conscious thoughts over very many years. In this letter, I specifically want to talk about what this means for our Relationship, expanding on the brief discussion we just had a few nights ago. Coincidentally, this also happens to be thematic – 齐家, which comes just after 修身.

The reason why I said I will be, and actually feel, happy for you to exercise complete freedom in our relationship is based on the lack of insecurities on my part – I will not use the words Trust and Faith for reasons which will become apparent below. 

I have intrinsically always believed in the lack of control over another, like I have mentioned very many years ago, but I did not know then why that is the case – I only knew it felt right.

It is only recently that I came to the conscious conclusion that exercising control over another’s freedom is not conducive for relationships between adults. As sentient beings, we are always changing, hopefully for the better, and limiting my very own partner makes zero sense to me. Instead, I turned inwards, focusing on myself in order to become a better person for the sake of myself and for you. Nobody else is responsible for my being after all – I am the protagonist in my own story.

Accordingly, this is one way I express my love. I have always chosen, and will continue to choose to, love you more regardless of the choices you make.

Just like before, I again stress that I do not expect you share my beliefs – we are distinct individuals after all, and I absolutely do not wish for us to become one and the same.

This brings us to the concepts of Trust and Faith. In the context of relationships, to Trust and to have Faith is the healthy way of dealing with one’s own insecurities. On the other hand, to deal with the insecurities by exercising control over another is simply dumping the problem onto someone else. The distinction is that the former has the potential to lead to resolution and growth, while the latter is stagnation and possibly even regression and abuse.

We are both aware of the insecurities you have, and I have always been immensely proud of you. The courage you have shown by Trusting and having Faith time and time again is something that I cannot even imagine. Please continue to be brave, and perhaps one day you will no longer be bound by your fears. The two of us are responsible for our own relationship, and again I promise you that nothing else will come between us.

I hope too, that you can turn inwards to understand yourself better. I know feelings is not your strong suit, but I am always here to help you in your journey – the protagonist in your very own life story.

Just like joy and happiness, there will also always be challenges and difficulties ahead. With utmost conviction, I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish regardless.

Yours truly,
Husband <This message was edited>

 https://careers.nus.edu.sg/NUS/job/YONG-LOO-LIN-SCH-OF-MEDICINE-Research-Assistant-%28Software-Research-Engineer-HRPC%29-Kent/24203844/
22/04/2024, 5:33 pm - Zheng Yifei: the wording is actually quite vague in terms of specific skills
22/04/2024, 5:34 pm - Zheng Yifei: so the best thing i can do now is probably design and implement a mini-project to show off what I can do wrt the data lake and "functionalities agreed on with HRPC’s Data Manager and researchers"
22/04/2024, 5:34 pm - Zheng Yifei: i.e. what Bing Yang describes the front-end to be like
22/04/2024, 5:35 pm - Zheng Yifei: i need to research on how data lake works and how I can abuse AWS data lake
22/04/2024, 5:35 pm - Zheng Yifei: "Familiarity with web and database development with modern tech stacks and technologies" --> this part right here
22/04/2024, 5:35 pm - Zheng Yifei: preferably implement entire stack on AWS
22/04/2024, 5:36 pm - Yvette Chen: cool :)

23/04/2024, 9:41 am - Zheng Yifei: There’s a lot of male-male dynamics involved
23/04/2024, 9:41 am - Yvette Chen: josh was like you ok? I'm like I've seen this all my life, relax
23/04/2024, 9:41 am - Yvette Chen: he was like I'm worried my 15 yo daughter will face this in her life mann

23/04/2024, 9:45 am - Zheng Yifei: And all the other associated “male” traits
23/04/2024, 9:48 am - Zheng Yifei: Maybe it’s just suppressed more, more infantile and archaic if they appear later 🤔
23/04/2024, 9:48 am - Zheng Yifei: This is Jung’s view, on the collective unconscious
23/04/2024, 9:55 am - Zheng Yifei: Actually I think a gay could have written the same book, but maybe it sounds more credible coming from a woman
23/04/2024, 9:58 am - Yvette Chen: hehe :)
23/04/2024, 9:58 am - Yvette Chen: oohh
23/04/2024, 9:59 am - Zheng Yifei: Oh but a gay cannot out himself as a female in the end 😂

26/04/2024, 8:52 pm - Zheng Yifei: I think this is interesting because not everyone smells upon sweating

That is why dodo doesn’t make much friends
26/04/2024, 10:18 pm - Zheng Yifei: In other words, one must be truly oneself to attract the like-minded

26/04/2024, 11:49 pm - Zheng Yifei: Come tell me some
26/04/2024, 11:49 pm - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
26/04/2024, 11:49 pm - Zheng Yifei: Before you shuishui
26/04/2024, 11:49 pm - Yvette Chen: is hubby bored 😴
26/04/2024, 11:49 pm - Yvette Chen: I am determined to shuishui late today hehe
26/04/2024, 11:52 pm - Zheng Yifei: Somehow queued for 30 min at Malaysia customs
26/04/2024, 11:52 pm - Zheng Yifei: Orh hehehe
26/04/2024, 11:54 pm - Yvette Chen: so I met quincy today. people are surprisingly self absorbed. he talked about how he spent his korea trip (with wife, kid and in laws) working and got scolded by his wife
26/04/2024, 11:54 pm - Zheng Yifei: No shit sure get scolded 😂
26/04/2024, 11:55 pm - Yvette Chen: he also got scolded by his in laws for not bathing his child and leaving everything to them, so now he's contemplating moving the child back to sg (from indo) so she'll get better discipline
26/04/2024, 11:55 pm - Yvette Chen: I'm wondering, meaning the wife will have more things to do?
26/04/2024, 11:56 pm - Zheng Yifei: Wait means the wife is here while the child is in Indonesia?
26/04/2024, 11:57 pm - Yvette Chen: then he talked about the family not receiving inheritance from his late mum for a year now, and he scolded his dad today for not actively following up on the issue
26/04/2024, 11:57 pm - Yvette Chen: yea
26/04/2024, 11:57 pm - Yvette Chen: I found it strange, like why I see no emotions except anger in this exchange
26/04/2024, 11:58 pm - Yvette Chen: Maybe I can't identify emotions well
26/04/2024, 11:58 pm - Zheng Yifei: This kind of people shouldn’t be parents what
26/04/2024, 11:58 pm - Zheng Yifei: Dunno rage what
26/04/2024, 11:58 pm - Zheng Yifei: He thinks have kid liao his life still proceed per before?
26/04/2024, 11:59 pm - Yvette Chen: He doesn't mind working non stop because his boss is his friend. quite interesting, I noticed I didn't ask about any of this - he just volunteered the info, hence self absorbed
27/04/2024, 12:00 am - Zheng Yifei: Ic <This message was edited>
27/04/2024, 12:01 am - Yvette Chen: and after researching the credit cards he recommended, very heavy on miles rewards and there's a hefty non-waiveable annual fee. so I gather prestige is important to him
27/04/2024, 12:01 am - Zheng Yifei: Ic
27/04/2024, 12:01 am - Yvette Chen: so I didn't apply for them, I don't believe in annual fees
27/04/2024, 12:01 am - Zheng Yifei: Interesting
27/04/2024, 12:02 am - Zheng Yifei: Annual fees are bullshit
27/04/2024, 12:02 am - Zheng Yifei: It negates everything
27/04/2024, 12:02 am - Zheng Yifei: Might as well use debit card
27/04/2024, 12:02 am - Zheng Yifei: Wait didn’t you say this dude works very efficiently
27/04/2024, 12:02 am - Zheng Yifei: Then he do what with the spare time
27/04/2024, 12:03 am - Yvette Chen: he used to. now it seems at supervisory position, he's struggling to balance his life
27/04/2024, 12:04 am - Zheng Yifei: lol
27/04/2024, 12:04 am - Yvette Chen: I believe I need to trust my staff or I'll have no life
27/04/2024, 12:05 am - Yvette Chen: Like can try to help them as long as it doesn't affect your schedule outside work. if they still crash and burn and take me down with them, find another job lor...
27/04/2024, 12:06 am - Zheng Yifei: Yes
27/04/2024, 12:06 am - Zheng Yifei: That is the expected boss behaviour
27/04/2024, 12:06 am - Zheng Yifei: Clearly that is not the norm
27/04/2024, 12:09 am - Yvette Chen: now move to Li Lan
27/04/2024, 12:10 am - Yvette Chen: yuanxi's dad has offered him to take over the company but it's going to take a lot of work
27/04/2024, 12:10 am - Zheng Yifei: Ic hehe
27/04/2024, 12:11 am - Yvette Chen: dad is some certified land surveyor so the job needs an engineering background
27/04/2024, 12:11 am - Yvette Chen: also as the entrepreneur, probably need to be meticulous
27/04/2024, 12:12 am - Zheng Yifei: lol how can he take over that
27/04/2024, 12:12 am - Yvette Chen: li lan wants to take over the company with yx because she believes he's not meticulous but she also believes the dad would prefer they don't put all their eggs in the same basket
27/04/2024, 12:14 am - Yvette Chen: she's also worried they won't win tenders, which I thought is strange because her current job is sales 🤔
27/04/2024, 12:14 am - Yvette Chen: maybe it hits different when it's your money vs your boss's money
27/04/2024, 12:15 am - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
27/04/2024, 12:15 am - Zheng Yifei: Interesting life change
27/04/2024, 12:16 am - Yvette Chen: but of course the common thread is unsolicited complaints about her boss only gave her 10% raise for the crazy amt of work, her staff are incompetent and her events are too close tgt
27/04/2024, 12:17 am - Yvette Chen: then the topic goes into her loving her current job regardless, so I guess push comes to shove, she prefers being an employee :)
27/04/2024, 12:18 am - Zheng Yifei: Hehe
27/04/2024, 12:18 am - Zheng Yifei: Employee has a lot of perks
27/04/2024, 12:18 am - Zheng Yifei: Sometimes under appreciated
27/04/2024, 12:20 am - Yvette Chen: and then she says currently she feels v appreciated by the boss now because event sales has more visibility with him
27/04/2024, 12:20 am - Yvette Chen: I guess it took her a number of years to realise that the choice of role is important 🤔
27/04/2024, 12:21 am - Zheng Yifei: Depends on what she wants to move on to hehe
27/04/2024, 12:22 am - Yvette Chen: In finance, management reporting is the only role appreciated by bosses cos it's where preemptive actions take place and they can give you their saikang
27/04/2024, 12:24 am - Yvette Chen: Functions like accounting / treasury - meeting timelines is a given. the only news that floats to bosses is audit delays / some significant accrual not made / or worse, erroneous payments
27/04/2024, 12:25 am - Zheng Yifei: Ic
27/04/2024, 12:25 am - Yvette Chen: very true, events is quite limited in terms of lateral paths unless that's the path she wants to take
27/04/2024, 12:26 am - Zheng Yifei: But wife no want to progress 😂
27/04/2024, 12:27 am - Yvette Chen: hehe I don't want but it's also the role that suits me most. focus on big picture, estimates and logical problem solving
27/04/2024, 12:28 am - Yvette Chen: I might die in an accounting / treasury role 🤔
27/04/2024, 12:28 am - Zheng Yifei: Hehehe
27/04/2024, 12:28 am - Yvette Chen: today josh asked me to look at the wood chipper diagram and describe how it works - definitely not my role but an example of random things they can throw at u
27/04/2024, 12:31 am - Zheng Yifei: Ic hehe
27/04/2024, 12:31 am - Zheng Yifei: Sounds fun
27/04/2024, 12:32 am - Yvette Chen: I was like ok this is the wood bed, laid at an angle (not parallel to the floor) so gravity does its work for you. wood is slid down on to the wood bed and then the knife comes in at this angle. why they want to reduce the angle of the knife is so there's less chance of hitting the edge, so less wear and tear and less knife changes
27/04/2024, 12:33 am - Yvette Chen: then he says good, now explain to the rest of the team. of course cash / accounting are wondering why they need to participate in this charade when they're so busy but we just had to humour him
27/04/2024, 12:33 am - Yvette Chen: conclusion - bosses get weird as they climb higher
27/04/2024, 12:33 am - Yvette Chen: yes it is :)
27/04/2024, 12:34 am - Zheng Yifei: Whut
27/04/2024, 12:34 am - Zheng Yifei: lol
27/04/2024, 12:38 am - Yvette Chen: also I discovered a random thing about brazilian accounting standards today while reviewing their work - since somehow I'm roped into accounting work this month
27/04/2024, 12:39 am - Yvette Chen: apparently they're required to discount their revenue based on number of days of credit terms they extend to the customers
27/04/2024, 12:39 am - Yvette Chen: i.e. revenue will be less than invoice amount. but customers will still pay the invoice amount and when they do this difference in revenue and invoice amount goes into interest income
27/04/2024, 12:39 am - Yvette Chen: same for cost
27/04/2024, 12:40 am - Yvette Chen: totally onerous and pointless procedure 🤔
27/04/2024, 12:42 am - Yvette Chen: okie end of today's stories :)
27/04/2024, 12:53 am - Zheng Yifei: Shopping for supplies at 7/11

27/04/2024, 7:17 am - Zheng Yifei: lol why must they do this for rev and cost too 🤔 <This message was edited>

27/04/2024, 10:23 pm - Yvette Chen: mum told me her youngest sister (the one with early stage breast cancer) felt uncomfortable when they went for qingming festival tgt and had to be hospitalised
27/04/2024, 10:24 pm - Yvette Chen: then tells me she wishes that'll happen to her too, so she can die and doesn't have to suffer from eye pain anymore
27/04/2024, 10:25 pm - Yvette Chen: thought maybe I heard wrongly, but she said it a second time after that
27/04/2024, 10:26 pm - Yvette Chen: v clearly has zero empathy for her siblings, and is also mistaken as to how painful cancer can be
27/04/2024, 10:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: lol
27/04/2024, 10:27 pm - Zheng Yifei: She thinks painless is it
27/04/2024, 10:28 pm - Yvette Chen: she now reads two religious books regularly (the bible and the buddhist teachings) - I don't think either is landing

27/04/2024, 10:31 pm - Yvette Chen: so she spent the dinner telling me their stories
27/04/2024, 10:31 pm - Zheng Yifei: Whut why
27/04/2024, 10:31 pm - Zheng Yifei: Why do some people get entangled in other ppl’s problems 🤔
27/04/2024, 10:31 pm - Zheng Yifei: Is it this thing called empathy
27/04/2024, 10:32 pm - Yvette Chen: the izayaki however has good agedashi tofu. dango, 串串, karaage and edamame are passable :)
27/04/2024, 10:33 pm - Yvette Chen: I think so
27/04/2024, 10:33 pm - Zheng Yifei: Ic, that’s not a good izayaki 😂

28/04/2024, 5:20 pm - Yvette Chen: she's still annoyed at her cousin's stuff - apparently he's her aunt's fav son and gets a free pass for his antics all the time, including having to shift an upcoming mother's day dinner because he'll be on holiday
28/04/2024, 5:22 pm - Yvette Chen: she had chicha bbt with pearls right after bbq box, which is impressive appetite
28/04/2024, 5:23 pm - Yvette Chen: Also allows all her incoming messages to be played out loud while she's driving, I guess she has nothing to hide 🤔

28/04/2024, 5:26 pm - Zheng Yifei: As in she involved in the dinner meh
28/04/2024, 5:27 pm - Yvette Chen: I'll prove you wrong
28/04/2024, 5:27 pm - Yvette Chen: cos apparently all cousins plan the dinner tgt, except the entitled one
28/04/2024, 5:27 pm - Yvette Chen: strange that the cousins behave like siblings but I guess every fam is different

28/04/2024, 7:32 pm - Yvette Chen: I just lol-ed, and said that's why I didn't wanna meet her in tw other than at the wedding. she's still being weird and I didn't wanna spoil my holiday :)
28/04/2024, 7:33 pm - Zheng Yifei: There’s an insanely toxic relationship
28/04/2024, 7:33 pm - Yvette Chen: dunno, didn't ask her to elaborate. I thought she would have without me asking
28/04/2024, 7:33 pm - Zheng Yifei: And it impacts everyone else including guests
28/04/2024, 7:33 pm - Yvette Chen: usually she does... so maybe she doesn't know 🤔
28/04/2024, 7:34 pm - Zheng Yifei: Jan’s mom and sis? What about Jan herself
28/04/2024, 7:34 pm - Yvette Chen: she says her view won't be accurate cos I did tell her what happened in cambodia <This message was edited>
28/04/2024, 7:35 pm - Yvette Chen: fair enough
28/04/2024, 7:35 pm - Yvette Chen: ??
28/04/2024, 7:35 pm - Zheng Yifei: But if 2 randoms think that, her views should be valid
28/04/2024, 7:35 pm - Yvette Chen: yea
28/04/2024, 7:35 pm - Zheng Yifei: Basically overall very awkward and tense sometimes
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: Like for example if a couple fight during a trip with other ppl, it might make it awkward for the rest right?
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: Similar
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: I’m usually rather unaffected about this kind of things but this situation is very severe
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: 3 trips all like that
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: Dunwan hang out with this couple alr
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Yvette Chen: they fought with each other? 🤔
28/04/2024, 7:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: All the time
28/04/2024, 7:37 pm - Yvette Chen: 😱
28/04/2024, 7:37 pm - Zheng Yifei: But not fight fight, like concealed disagreements
28/04/2024, 7:37 pm - Yvette Chen: not dennis / pamela?

28/04/2024, 7:40 pm - Zheng Yifei: I’m still confused, what did Doreen do lol
28/04/2024, 7:40 pm - Yvette Chen: possibly social cues we won't catch anyway, or you would've reacted
28/04/2024, 7:40 pm - Yvette Chen: so it doesn't matter

28/04/2024, 7:47 pm - Zheng Yifei: When we are out we are 2 individuals as much as we are spouse
28/04/2024, 7:47 pm - Zheng Yifei: I do not believe that just cause married or attached alr means everything turns “coupley”
28/04/2024, 8:01 pm - Zheng Yifei: Let me think about how to tell this story hehe
28/04/2024, 8:02 pm - Zheng Yifei: Evidently anything that involves a group have politics and lots of interpersonal dynamics

03/05/2024, 6:19 pm - Yvette Chen: I kept my distance from the counter cos my colleagues ordered first and there were 2 ladies trying to figure out which is their drink on the counter
03/05/2024, 6:20 pm - Yvette Chen: overall there's no one else in the vicinity and there's only one drink in the back after my colleagues asked for their drinks and the 2 ladies are still confused (v strange)

03/05/2024, 6:34 pm - Yvette Chen: they used to send me down to buy for them, hence the daily visit regardless of whether I'm getting coffee for myself <This message was edited>
03/05/2024, 6:36 pm - Yvette Chen: now it's like they have to make a pilgrimage daily and they start wondering why I buy other drinks 🤔
03/05/2024, 6:36 pm - Zheng Yifei: LOL
03/05/2024, 6:36 pm - Yvette Chen: my behaviour actually didn't change, they did

04/05/2024, 1:10 pm - Zheng Yifei: Because people only keep her around to satisfy their own wants, then once dodo cannot/refuse provide then byebye alr
04/05/2024, 1:10 pm - Zheng Yifei: Also, do people even know her?
04/05/2024, 1:10 pm - Yvette Chen: oops
04/05/2024, 1:10 pm - Zheng Yifei: Her true self, not the people pleasing self
04/05/2024, 1:12 pm - Yvette Chen: yea I get what you mean :)
04/05/2024, 1:12 pm - Zheng Yifei: Maybe she thinks that pleasing people can get others to like her and therefore satisfy some other needs, but it doesn’t work out I think
